<h3 style="text-align:center">MICROSOFT TALENT INDIA 2014</h3>
				
							<br><br><p>Students of Dronacharya College of Engineering got this unforgettable opportunity to attend a Microsoft Event: Talent India 2014 at hotel Taj Palace on 30th September 2014. The event started off by the inspiring and motivational speech by Mr. Satya Nadella, CEO Microsoft. The hall exhibited tremendous energy as he addressed the youth of India. He was followed by yet another informational address by the youngest minister in the priminsterial cabinet Mrs. Smriti Irani, HRD Minister. She detailed various policies introduced and to be introduced by the government.<br><br>
Then the students got a chance to listen to MS. Rane Johnson, Research Head, Microsoft wherein she discussed her journey to becoming the research head of Microsoft. Lastly the event was concluded with the motivational words of Mr. Bhaskar Pramanik, Chairman at Microsoft India. He discussed various achievements, roadmaps and new technologies introduced by Microsoft.
Shared below are the details of the speech delivered by the dignitaries.<br><br>
<u><strong>Satya Nadella on his 'surreal' journey</u></strong><br><br>
Nadella, who is only the third CEO that Bill Gates-founded Microsoft has had in its nearly four-decades-long history, said businesses were looking forward to an accelerated growth phase in India and technology could play a pivotal role in spurring that growth. "Growth will need computing infrastructure on a massive scale," he said.<br><br>
Hyderabad-born Nadella, who studied engineering at Manipal University and was part of the early wave of engineers who moved to the US, said his journey from "home here in India to Microsoft" where he has spent 22 years was "incredible and humbling".
He urged the present lot of engineers in India seeking technology careers to be bold and tenacious. "My advice to those who are pursuing careers in technology is to really think about the work you're driving and why it matters. Believe that you can make it happen and go after it with boldness and tenacity. And remember that success doesn't happen overnight, be persistent and ask yourself what you can do to push to the next level each day," said Nadella, who is a cricket buff and loves running.
He says about his journey” When I think back, I never grew up thinking that I'll go west of Mumbai and then I land up in Wisconsin.<br><br>
Believe me, my journey has not been a simple journey of progress. There have been many ups and downs and it is the choices that I made at each of those times  that have helped shape what I have achieved”.
He continues that as a youth prepare to change the world, the opportunity before you is unparalleled.
All of us  represent a multi-disciplinary approach to innovation - and that will change the future.
The mobile first, cloud first is a very rich canvas for innovation - it is not the device that is mobile, it is the person that is mobile.<br><br>
How can we create platforms, how can we be the tools provider so that others can realise their potential? Today we launched our commercial cloud services
The energy you create around you is perhaps going to be the most important attribute -- in the long run EQ trumps IQ. Without being a source of energy for others very little can be accomplished.
Every opportunity I got I took it as a learning experience.
You have to fall in love with what you do because everything else then becomes so easy. Most importantly it is perhaps the best way to find meaning in what you do...<br><br>
Lastly he ended his session with a
Quotes Mahatma Gandhi - Live everyday as if it your last day but learn as if you are going to live forever...
<br><br>
<u><strong>Union Minister Smriti Irani says Satya Nadella is a difficult speaker to top</u></strong><br><br>
She says “We are anxious today because there is a huge expectation from all of you (the youth).We recognize that expectation  and it is the youngsters of this country who gave us this mandate - this mandate is your mandate
Satya spoke of IQ and EQ - I  bring in the GQ component - the governance component. We are making available open resources to all students from economically challenged backgrounds.I spoke this morning to Mr Nadella about the various initiatives we are undertaking.There are some who mock us at times for being overly dependent  on social media , on information technology dreams -- but we have seen the benefits of that.<br><br>
She continued  that “The Army in Jammu and Kashmir through social media managed to provide support to 12000 people -- how technology can help us is some of the experiences I have shared today.
All the youngsters who are watching us today, I hope through this transformation you will make your parents proud...<br>
Satya quoted Gandhiji - let me quote him to say –“ Be the change you want to see.”<br><br>
“This platform was given to us by a man who began by tinkering with his tools in a garage and I stand here as a representative of a person who began  as a tea-seller.
Out do not others but your own potential.”<br><br>
