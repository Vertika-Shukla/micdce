		<h3 style="text-align:center">Microsoft Cloud Data DevCamp</h3>
							<br><br>
						<p>
Microsoft organized an event “Web DevCamp” at Microsoft Corporation (India), Gurgaon on 26th August 2015. Six students from Computer Science and Engineering department and Eight Students from Electronics and Computer Engineering Department attended this event. The objective of this event is to introduce the participants with new languages and use them for building innovative websites. Mr. Sudhir Rawat (Big Data Engineer at Microsoft INDIA R&D Pvt. Ltd.) delivered the session.

This camp was on how to blend data services and platforms in azure. The event started with the keynote lecture, delivered by Mr. Sudhir Rawat in which he introduced about Microsoft Cluster Server (MSCS). MSCS is a computer program that allows server computers to work together as a computer cluster, to provide failover and increased availability of applications, or parallel calculating power in case of high-performance computing (HPC) clusters (as in supercomputing). After that, the speaker gave the information about hadoop cluster and its working.

In the next Session, the Mr. Rawat continued discussion of hadoop cluster and its features. Microsoft servers provide three technologies to support clustering:

1. Network Load Balancing (NLB)

2. Component Load Balancing (CLB)

3. Microsoft Cluster Service (MSCS).

Then he showed the demo that how students can create cluster in Microsoft cluster server and also discussed about different type of clusters for ex - HBase, Hive, Spark, Storm etc. with its advantages and disadvantages.

He discussed about Real time Analytics & its uses in all available enterprise data and resources when they are needed. The reference architecture for real-time event processing with Azure Stream Analytics is intended to provide a generic blueprint for deploying a real-time platform as a service (PaaS) stream-processing solution with Microsoft Azure. In Azure Stream Analytics, these subsets of events are defined through windows to represent groupings by time.

The sessions were very helpful as students came to know various types of clusters, significance of each cluster and how Microsoft azure stream analytics help the mob to work on the Real-time analytics.

The session ended with a discussion on use this feature. It was really an interactive and knowledgeable session.

		<h3 style="text-align:center">Microsoft Azure Vidyapeeth Day</h3>
							<br><br>
						<p>
Microsoft organized a one day event on AZURE VIDYAPEETH DAY at Microsoft Corporation (India) Pvt. Ltd., Gurgaon on 8th August 2015. Four students namely Gaurav Verma (15709), Mohit Panchal (15720), Dinesh Yadav (15707) and Bhuvash Yadav (16778) from Electronics and Computer Engineering Department of Dronacharya College of Engineering, Gurgaon attended the event.

The objective of the event was to provide one day training by introducing the power of business with Microsoft Azure. The event was started with the Keynote Session by Mr. Rajiv Arora, Senior Premier Field Engineer, Microsoft Services and Mr.Vaibhav Gupta, Sr. Premier Field Engineer Information Security at Microsoft.

Mr. Arora started the session with an introduction on Azure. He explained that it is a growing collection of integrated services that helps to move faster, do more and increase productivity. He then detailed about the most common question for Azure i.e. security. He said that in general day to day discussion with Infra and DB professionals the biggest question occurs that how to ensure the data safety when one hosts data out of the premise. He further discussed on the MSIT leveraging Azure and what kind of challenges are faced while migrating to Azure.

Mr. Gupta then introduced the participants to Azure - Microsoft’s cloud platform. The speaker highlighted that Azure supports the broadest selection of operating systems, programming languages, frameworks, tools, databases and devices. Run Linux containers with Docker integration; build apps with JavaScript, Python, .NET, PHP, Java and Node.js; build back-ends for iOS, Android and Windows devices. Azure supports the same technologies millions of developers and IT professionals already rely on and trust.He further added that Azure has custom-built moderation techniques that protect against DDOS attacks. If a DDOS attack originates from within the network, the VM that has it contained is removed immediately. When a hard drive is retired, it goes through a 7-step wiping operation to verify no data is compromised.

Mr. Gupta finally added that Microsoft Azure currently has more than 20 cloud computing related security compliance certificates, including ISO 27001 and 27018.

The event was very knowledgeable as the participants came to know about Microsoft Azure and it’s feature.

							<br><br>
						<p>
                       On 12th February 2015 MsSarita, and Ms. Poonam Assistant Professors from Dronacharya college of Engineeirng, Gurgaon attended “Implementing a mobile -first enterprise device strategy IT camps” by Microsoftat Radisson Blu Hotel Dwarka, New Delhi.<br><br>
Ms.Pracheta Budhwar (Technology Evangelist at Microsoft Corporation India Pvt. Ltd) & Mr.Ninadwere were the speaker of the Microsoft IT camp.<br><br>

The Main Agenda for this IT camp was Introduction to Microsoft Azure Directory & implementing MFA for Azure Accounts. Azure Active Directory is a service that provides identity and access management capabilities in the cloud. Application developers can integrate their applications with Azure AD to provide single sign-on functionality for their users. This enables enterprise applications to be hosted in the cloud and to easily authenticate users with corporate credentials. It also enables software as a service (SaaS) providers to make authentication easier for users in Azure AD organizations when authenticating to their services. Multi-factor or two-factor authentication (MFA) is a method of authentication that requires the use of more than one verification method and adds a critical second layer of security to user sign-ins and transactions.
<br><br>
In Lab Session topic with how to integrate Saas Apps with azure Ad was implemented.Session ended with the Q & A round.
<br><br>
Microsoft IT camp, Delhi provided an opportunity to get familiar with app Protection & Device Management with Intune. The event provided information on the Azure service that can be used for identity and access management capabilities in the cloud.
