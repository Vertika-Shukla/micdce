Faculties from various departments, i.e. Computer Science, Information Technology, Electronics and Communication, Electronics and Computer Science of Amity attended the workshop.

 
Microsoft organised the workshop on IoT and Machine Learning in which Faculties were taught the basics of IoT, and then how to connect a virtual server using Virtual Machine and Prediction using Machine Learning.

 
Trainers explained different things related to IoT and Machine Learning to the faculties of Amity. They described how to activate an account on Azure and they were all given a unique key for their Azure account subscription.

 
After the account activation in azure, next topic was how to publish a site to Azure using Web Matrix which was then followed by a lab session. Nishant along with Mohit helped the faculties in performing the same. Then, hosting a website using FTP client server and Windows Explorer were covered, followed by a lab session conducted by Nishant and Mohit.

 
Microsoft trainers explained the basics of Internet of Things (IoT) and Machine learning. Faculties also got to know about Raspberry Pie 2. Mr. Suketu, along with Nishant and Mohit demonstrated the use of Raspberry Pie 2 by deploying an example in which they showed that how we can control the switching of a bulb using remote device by an App.
